<article><h2>About me</h2></article>
<main>
    <p>Today, I want to say my name is Utpal Patel. I am a software maker.<br>I do not like doing the same thing again and again. It's worse if the thing I make does not help solve a problem. I like to wake up to new things to work on. It makes me feel good to know more and solve new issues.</p>

    
    <p>When I am not at work, I like to go to new places and see the view. I like to learn about new places and their ways. I like to read books, walk, hike, and be with friends and kin. These things help me to feel good and take it slow in life.
